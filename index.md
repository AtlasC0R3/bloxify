## NOTICE

**I have not tested this yet, I am still waiting for an answer on how the Roblox censorship should work in public games! If you use this, you are on your own for now. You *should* be fine without any censorship if you are displaying info about what the local user is currently playing on Spotify, however I am unsure if this statement is true. You will have to put a censorship if you share what the local user is listening to, to other players.** Also don't make the user play songs that contain swearing. Or NSFW. If you do that, you're big dumb man. ~~And will make me cry.~~

# Bloxify
An API wrapper for Spotify, built for Roblox games, to connect Roblox and Spotify together. This can be utilised in many ways: an overlay for FPS games, a replacement for paid "boombox" game passes, a way to pause the in-game music if the user is playing something on Spotify, or even a replacement for any in-game music player. *\*cough\*, those are all ideas I just came up with, they probably have flaws. so uh, yeah.*

## Usage

I've run out of things to say here, um..
